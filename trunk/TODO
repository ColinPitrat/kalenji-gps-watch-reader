 * Clean code: separated files, no global var
 * Use info retrieved by the first 80 call
 * Cleaner way to handle id_point (used to find first and last point of a lap)
 * Create dir if it doesn't exist, make its path an option
 * Improve metadata (add link among others)
 * More info on point (cadence, hr when available) ? What is cadence ? Different from pace and speed ?
 * Add options handling (target directory, debug, interactive mode to choose sessions to import ...) and rc file
 * In case of error we should finish reading until getting 8Axxx so that the device is in a clean state
 * Provide an interactive mode giving the list of sessions with ID and asking which ones should be retrieved
