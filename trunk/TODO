 * Implement options to override configuration
 * Documentation on options
 * Clean code: separated files, no global var
 * Use info retrieved by the first 80 call and by 78 call
 * Cleaner way to handle id_point (used to find first and last point of a lap)
 * Improve metadata (add link among others)
 * In case of error we should finish reading until getting 8Axxx so that the device is in a clean state
 * Add possibility to define different trigger type (Manual, Distance, HR, Location, Time) for each session (or each lap ?)
 * Study options offered by GPXDATA: http://www.cluetrust.com/Schemas/gpxdata10.xsd
 * Remove laps with distance = 0, elapsed = 0, startPoint = endPoint ... (think about it !)
 * Option to import from import logs instead of from device in order to be able to reimport it later with newer version of the soft
 * Only put extensions - heartrate if info is present and non zero
