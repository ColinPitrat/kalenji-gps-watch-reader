 *                       Documentation on options
 * device::Kalenji:      Use info retrieved by the first 80 call and by 78 call
 * device::Kalenji:      Cleaner way to handle id_point (used to find first and last point of a lap)
 * device::Kalenji:      In case of error we should finish reading until getting 8Axxx so that the device is in a clean state (== implement release ?)
 * output::GPX:          Improve metadata (add link among others)
 * output::GPX:          Study options offered by GPXDATA: http://www.cluetrust.com/Schemas/gpxdata10.xsd
 * output::GPX:          Study options offered by GPXTPX
 *                       Add possibility to define different trigger type (Manual, Distance, HR, Location, Time) for each session (or each lap ?)
 *                       Export of route to the device (source = File, device = GPX, output = Kalenji ? therefore, output would use source = USB ... to generalize for file too ?)
 *                       Factorize code converting date to string (calls to strftime - to put in some utils part ?)
 * bom::Session          Improve interface
 * bom::Session          Method to remove point (handling adjusting laps)
 *                       Check configuration file syntax (allowing comments)
 *                       Add some exceptions to handle error cases
 * output::GoogleMap     Rename as HTML ? (breaking change !!)
 * output::GoogleMap     Use max speed and min speed to determine the color range
 * output::GoogleMap     Use max hr and min hr to determine the width range
 * output::GoogleMap     Use something else for the icon of lap ending
 * output::GoogleMap     Add a flag at the beginning with race information (~ same as lap for the whole race + date and more if available)
 *                       Use singleton for configuration ? Instead of passing it to output as argument of dump.
 *                       Support environment variables and references to other variables in configuration ?
 *                       Review (again) the architecture. Source could be connector (USB or File) used for reading & writing. Device and output could be format (Kalenji, GPX, KML etc ...) usable for read & write. Would logger enveloppe still be needed ? Using Kalenji + File as output to log wouldn't work so I'd say yes ! Does it bring an advantage over supporting device and output separately ? This would probalby not factorize much code and sending XML over USB or Kalenji in a file wouldn't make much sense ...
 * bom::Session          Compute distance and duration from points
 *                       Use ComputeSessionStat and ReducePoints by default when exporting to device ?
 * filter                A filter that remove performance data (date and time, heartrate, speed) to only produce a trace.
 *                       Create a bom for runner (weight, height, max heartrate, age ... name ? )
