USB mass storage is used by OnMove510 & 710
The device contains 3 file per session:
 - GHT contains the track information
 - GHL contains the laps details
 - GHP contains the points details
With minimal modifications, using File as source and a slightly modified version of Kalenji as device should do the trick.
Only difference is that there are three files, and list of sessions is done with a ls => some dev to do for this.
But asking user for an automount and for the path in configuration, it should be really simple.
