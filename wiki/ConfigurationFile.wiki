=Where to place your configuration file=

You can modify the default behavior of kalenji_reader by putting a .kalenji_readerrc file in your home directory. 

For example for a user called toto, the configuration file will be:
{{{
/home/toto/.kalenjirc
}}}

=Options available=

Currently, the only thing you can configure is the directory where the imported file will be put. For example, if the user toto wants the import to be done in a subdirectory Running of his home directory, he will put the following in his configuration file:

{{{
directory=/home/toto/Running
}}}
