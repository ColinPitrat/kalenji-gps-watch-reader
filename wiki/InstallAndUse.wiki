#summary How to install and use kalenji_reader.
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Installing =

There is no package distributed (yet ?) so you have to get latest release from svn.

{{{
svn checkout http://kalenji-gps-watch-reader.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ kalenji-gps-watch-reader-read-only
cd kalenji-gps-watch-reader-read-only
make
}}}

= Using =

For now, data is imported in /tmp/kalenji_import. You have to create the directory before using the tool (probaly at each usage as tmp is usually wiped out at startup).

*From the directory where you built the tool*:

{{{
mkdir -p /tmp/kalenji_import
./kalenji_reader
}}}

GPX files are created in /tmp/kalenji_import and can be imported in your favorite software.

= Debug mode =

In case you notice a bug and you want to report it or if you have a CW 700 and you want to help me add the support for heartrate, you will need to use debug mode to produce a file containing debug information.

For this, edit the file main.cc and replace the following line
{{{
#define DEBUG 0
}}}
by
{{{
#define DEBUG 1
}}}

Then rebuild and run the tool:
{{{
make
mkdir -p /tmp/kalenji_import
./kalenji_reader | tee debug_information.txt
}}}

You will see a lot of information that will also be written in the file debug_information.txt. You can attach this file to a bug report to provide more information on what was the content of the communication between the GPS device and your computer.
