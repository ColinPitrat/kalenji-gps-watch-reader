#summary How to install and use kalenji_reader.
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

You can either install featured versions from a distributed package or current development version from SVN.

= Installing from package =

Download a package from [http://code.google.com/p/kalenji-gps-watch-reader/downloads/list Downloads section]

For example, if you downloaded version 1.0:

{{{
tar -xvzf kalenji-gps-watch-reader-1.0.tar.gz
cd kalenji-gps-watch-reader
make
}}}

= Installing from SVN =

If you prefer to get the latest version, with bleeding edge features but also potentially more bugs:

{{{
svn checkout http://kalenji-gps-watch-reader.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ kalenji-gps-watch-reader-read-only
cd kalenji-gps-watch-reader-read-only
make
}}}

= Using =

By default, data is imported in /tmp/kalenji_import. You can modify it by editing your ConfigurationFile. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.

*From the directory where you built the tool*:

{{{
./kalenji_reader
}}}

GPX files created can be imported in your favorite software.

= Debug mode =

In case you encounter a core and you want to report it, you will need to use debug mode to produce a file containing debug information.

Then rebuild and run the tool:
{{{
make debug
mkdir -p /tmp/kalenji_import
./kalenji_reader 2>&1 | tee kalenji_reader_output.txt
}}}

The output of kalenji_reader will be written in kalenji_reader_output.txt. You can attach this file, an eventual core and logs of the import to a bug report to provide more information on the problem.
