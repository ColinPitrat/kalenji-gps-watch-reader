# About kalenji_reader

Linux build: [![Linux build status](https://www.travis-ci.com/ColinPitrat/kalenji-gps-watch-reader.svg?branch=master)](https://www.travis-ci.com/ColinPitrat/kalenji-gps-watch-reader)

Windows build: [![Windows build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ds86ya5oknf4h0uq?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ColinPitrat/kalenji-gps-watch-reader)

This tool allows to import data from some running watches.

It creates GPX, TCX and Fitlog files that should be usable with any software supporting those file formats.

The GPX files produced have been tested in:

  * pytrainer      ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/pytrainer/ )
  * SportsTracker  ( http://www.saring.de/sportstracker/ )
  * Turtle Sport   ( http://turtlesport.sourceforge.net/ )
  * Endomondo      ( https://www.endomondo.com/ )
  * Runkeeper      ( https://runkeeper.com/ )

but should work with any other application or website supporting GPX files.

Main functionalities are:

  * import data from watch or from GPX files
  * export data to GPX, TCX, Fitlog, KML, HTML, JPG ...
  * automatically fix elevation information using Google Elevation API
  * upload route from your computer to the watch
  * replay your session in 3D in Google Earth
  * support for Linux and Windows

Watches known to be supported are:

  * W Kalenji 300 GPS
  * CW Kalenji 700 GPS
  * GPS On Move 500
  * GPS On Move 700
  * CW Kalenji 500 SD
  * Keymaze 500
  * Keymaze 500 Hiking
  * Keymaze 700
  * Keymaze 700 Trail
  * Pyle PGSPW1 (but feedback would be appreciated)
  * GPS On Move 100
  * GPS On Move 200
  * GPS On Move 220 (specifying OnMove200 as device)
  * GPS On Move 510
  * GPS On Move 710
  * NavBike 400

Watches that should be supported but for which feedback would be appreciated:

  * CW Kalenji 500 Play SD
  * W Kalenji 500 SD

If the information above is not correct or if you have a watch that is missing from the list, please contact me so that I can update it.

You have another device and would like to have it supported ? If you are ready to spend some time to provide me samples of USB dumps from imports done on windows, please contact me (if you don't know how to do the dumps, I'll explain you).
You can also have a look at other projects to check if they support your watch:
  * https://github.com/mru00/crane_gps_watch
  * http://www.gpsbabel.org/

# Install and use

## Dependencies

To be able to build kalenji_reader, you'll need the following dependencies:

 - libusb 1.0
 - libxml 2
 - libcurl

## Building and using

From the directory containing this README.txt:

    make

By default, data is imported in /tmp/kalenji_import. You can modify it by creating a .kalenji_readerrc file in your home (see Configuration File for more details). If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created.

To import data from your watch, ensure it's properly connected then launch:

    ./kalenji_reader

GPX files created can then be imported in your favorite software. HTML files created can be displayed in a browser supporting java script provided you are connected to internet. KML files can be read in Google Earth or any other software supporting it.

# Debug mode

In case you encounter a core dump, please reproduce it in debug before submitting an issue. To do so, use make debug instead of make. Also use ulimit to allow the OS creating corefiles in case your distribution disable it by default.

    make debug
    ulimit -c unlimited
    ./kalenji_reader 2>&1 | tee kalenji_reader_output.txt

This way, program output will also be written in the file kalenji_reader_output.txt. You can attach this file and the core to a bug report to provide more information on what was the problem.

# Configuration file

 * Where to place your configuration file

     You can modify the default behavior of kalenji_reader by putting a .kalenji_readerrc file in your home directory.
     For example for a user called toto, the configuration file will be:

     > /home/toto/.kalenji_readerrc

 * Options available

   - **Output directory**

      Name: directory

      Default value: /tmp/kalenji_import

      You can configure the directory where the imported file will be put. 
      For example, if the user toto wants the import to be done in a subdirectory Running of his home directory, he will put the following in his configuration file:

      > directory=/home/toto/Running

   - **Default import behavior**

      Name: import

      Default value: all

      You can decide whether you prefer to always:
       - be prompted for sessions to import each time you run kalenji_import
         > import=ask
       - import all sessions available on the watch
         > import=all

      The latter is longer if you don't want all sessions but it asks less questions so if you erase the sessions from your watch after importing them you will probably prefer it.

   - **Default trigger type**

      Name: trigger

      Default value: manual

      The information of the kind of event that triggered the end of a lap is, as far as I know, not given by the watch. 
      This setting provide the value that will always be used. It must be one of:

       - manual: user pressing the "end of lap" button of the watch
       - distance: a distance being run
       - time: a time being elapsed
       - location: a given location being reached (not possible with those watch)
       - hr: a given heartrate being reached (not possible with those watch) 

   - **Filters**

      Name: filters

      Default value: UnreliablePoints,EmptyLaps

      List of filters to apply on imported data before exporting it. A list of filters separated by coma. Use 'none' for no filter.

      Filters can be:

       - EmptyLaps: Remove laps with null distance or null duration
       - UnreliablePoints: Remove points for which the device gives a low reliability
       - NullHeartrate: Copy heartrate from previous point for points that have null value of heartrate
       - FixElevation: Use GoogleMap API to determine the correct elevation of all points of the session
       - ComputeSessionStats: Compute information at session level from points (distance, duration, max and average speed, ascent, descent ...)
       - ReducePoints: Reduce the number of points by removing points that are not far from being aligned. This is usefull when needing to upload a route that has more than 200 points to the watch.

   - **Outputs**

      Name: outputs

      Default value: GPX,GoogleMap

      List of formats to which data should be exported.

      Outputs can be:

       - GPX: GPX format, an XML file conforming to GPX and GPXDATA standards
       - GoogleMap: an HTML page containing necessary code to display the route on a google map
       - GoogleStaticMap: an URL using Google API to produce a static picture of the route. As the API limit URL size, it is a simplified version for long routes
       - KML: a file to be opened in Google Earth. It could also work with other software supporting KML files. 
       - Kalenji: to export a route to the device

   - **Log transactions**

      Name: log_transactions

      Default value: yes

      If set to yes, the raw information read from the watch is logged in hexadecimal in log files. 
      The purpose is to allow reimporting the data later even if it has been removed from the watch. It can also be usefull for debugging purpose.
      It's advised to keep it activated it as it is a way to save raw data, allowing to reimport it if a bug is fix or a new functionality activated.

      By default, the log files are created in a subdirectory logs of the output directory but this can be configured with configuration variable described next.

   - **Log transactions directory**

      Name: log_transactions_directory

      Default value: logs subdirectory in output directory

      The directory where raw data from the watch is logged if this functionality is activated. 

# Command line options

   - -h: help

     Show the usual help message giving supported options

   - -c: configuration file

     Provide the configuration file to use instead of ~/.kalenji_readerrc"

   - -d: output directory

     Directory to which output files should be produced. Override value of "directory" given in configuration file.

   - -f: filters

     Comma separated list of filters to apply on data before the export. Override value of "filters" given in configuration file.

   - -o: outputs

     Comma separated list of output formats to produce for each session. Override value of "filters" given in configuration file.

   - -t: trigger

     Provide the type of trigger. Override value of "trigger" given in configuration file.

   - -D: device

     Type of device to use. For now, can be either 'GPX' to convert a GPX file or a watch model (Kalenji, Keymaze, OnMove100, OnMove710, CWKalenji500SD, PylePGSPW1)

   - -i: input file

     Provide input file. This is mandatory for device 'GPX'. When used with device 'Kalenji' this allows to import from logs of a previous import.

   - -v: verbose

     Display detailed information of what is going on. Very useful for debugging or when reporting issues.
